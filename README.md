Short Description of assignment-2 :

First query: I took two user inputs and combined them using addition, adding a space character to separate the first and last names. I just made a new variable called string_alternative and concatenated all the even indexed variables to it. Regarding calling the main function, I have developed a main function that calls the supplied "string_alternative" function by utilising the special variable "name".

Second query: I used the open() and read() functions to open and read a text file that I had previously prepared with input. Afterwards, divided the file's words using the split() method and saved the results in a list. used the count() function to write the word count and created a new file called output_file.txt.

Third question: Took heights input in inches and appended them to a list using the append() function, simply create a new list and append all the heights by converting them to cm, i.e., 1 inch = 2.54 cm. The loop was designed to break when the input was less than zero.
